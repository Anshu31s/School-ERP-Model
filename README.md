# School ERP System

## Overview

This **School Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System** is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline administrative tasks and improve efficiency in managing student, teacher, and school data. The system integrates key features like attendance tracking, grade management, fee payments, analytics, and user-specific access to provide an all-in-one solution for schools.
